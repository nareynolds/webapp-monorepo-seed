title: Publishing with Github Pages
---

# Why?
- A repo should be entirely self documenting.
- The documentation should be easy to access and navigate.
- Creating/Updating the documentation should be easy and have establish conventions to follow.
- Publishing should be as cheap as possible.

# How?
All documentation for how this starter repo is setup and intended to be used should be documented and published using Github Pages.

# What?
- All documentation detailing this repo and its use will be published with Github Pages, the out-of-the-box Jekyll build, and minimal customization.
- All Pages will be in the `/docs` directory to isolate it from all code.
